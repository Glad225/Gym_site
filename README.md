Welcome to the Gym site, This project is designed to help individuals apply to be a gym goer, get appropriate information about what gym site entails.This project was done by me alone, i don't like seeing people, standing in queues just to register for gym,so that's why this is created, to help people apply at the comfort of their homes. For now this project is just frontend built no database or backend in it, due to time and other factors. also no Licensing to this project for now
